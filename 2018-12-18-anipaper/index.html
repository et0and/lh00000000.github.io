            <p><b>process</b>: we were inspired by sol lewitt's procedural works and wanted to create a piece where we could use stop motion to unveil the emergent patterns of some kind of collection of rules, materially by affecting and preparing a collection of paper. to experiment with creating these generative systems, we painted paper (mostly watercolor paper, but also some card-like and thin-crinkly tracing paper) gradients of grays and blacks, then stacked them in constrasting order. we took turns creating simple rules for cutting the top-most sheet of paper. when the paper was destroyed, the next person would come up with a rule set. rules were things like, "only add a cut starting more clockwise than the previous ones, then continue the line-cut until an intersection happens" but i honestly don't remember a lot of the rulesets at this point.</p>

        <div class="scrap" id="finalCut">
            <p><b>the final cut</b> for the video was made from the single session of improvisation we did. i think we were all a tiny bit disappointed that time did not allow us to take the experience we got and go back to make something that synthesized what we learned from our experiments with layering/cutting/wetting more, but overall, i thought it was a very exciting to collaborate with sukanya and rashida. the ideas came faster than we had time to implement, which was fantastic.</p>
