        <img src="https://lh00000000-public.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/siteimg/2019-03-14-dovetailfailure/IMG_6104.jpg" width="800px">
        <div>
            <p>my original inclination was to start with the <a href="https://lh00000000-public.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/siteimg/2019-03-14-dovetailfailure/15868308421_3c9355b6a9_o.png">most rudimentary joint i could find on</a> <a href="http://emesskay.com/">Meredith Scheff-King</a>'s 50 digital joint posterthen make as many as possible. but because i was was already in the time period allocated for the final project, and learned from my previous attempt at the cnc that whatever i intent to be the basic exercise will probably end up being the open thing i accomplish, i decided attempting a "finger tendon" would be a good balance of rudimentariness and usefulness. if time allowed (which it did not) i would attempt a hidden version of the finger tendon</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>my design was to put the joint on an edge of material long enough for a few repetitions. my idea was that if i practiced this joint design enough, i would be able to scale it up by simply repeating the joint pattern more to use for bigger projects. and that having a joint as small as my 1/4 dia end mill could go would leave me with the most versitile design.</p>
            <p>the radius of the nubs should be the radius of the end mill + some small affordance i don't remember right now. the valley between the nubs is about the same in width but i suppose that could be reduced. the depth of the joint from the outer edge of the material into the material should be the same as the material thickness. the areas where there is no cutout for a joint should be at most the width of the cutout of the joint, which i implemented using an "offset" command in vectorworks, but later regretted not considering that the offset expands in all directions, so i ended up with twice the amount of affordance than i desired.</p>

            <p>i forfeited my initial attempt because i set my original too close to the edge of the material. the piece had no security for my final cut so my cutout began to rattle and i became too worried about my end mill to continue.</p>

            <p>i learned i needed to get a lot more material. prototyping is wasteful. i finally learned to learned to use the table saw by asking Ayal. i cut a scrap piece i found, went to other classes and worked on other things, then couldn't find the piece i cut anymore. i found a similar piece however, which was only mildly annoying because i had to go back to vectorworks to account for my new material thickness.</p>

            <h2>second pass</h2>
            <p>my contour did not make it through the material, which could be for various reasons (i set my origin too high, the spoilboard was warped downward, i didn't secure my material flat enough, i didn't measure my material thickness correct and thus put a shallow pocket in my gcode etc). unfortunely, i forgot this person's name, but a 2nd year who was using the 4 axis for their thesis project on creating a lens that would correct a distorted image was around to recommend restarting the job with the same origin for my x and y, and manually setting the z a few steps past the surface elevation of my material. i should have taken into account the amonut of retract i had programmed in my gcode but things worked out anyways.
