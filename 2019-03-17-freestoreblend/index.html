    	<p id="introtxt">this post is almost a month late. it is a report of my second session with the free store. i can't believe how late this is. what's wrong with me. this happened 2019-02-22.</p>

    	<div id="goal">
	    	<img src="https://lh00000000-public.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/siteimg/2019-03-17-freestoreblend/IMG_5815.jpg">
	    	<p>anyways, my goal was to tackle a third of the dreaded "bottom shelf"</p>
    	</div>

    	<div id="started">
    		<p>i started by putting everything on a table, like last time, but i quickly realized that the items on the bottom shelf were larger, so this didn't really seem like i would get a lot of data out of it, and just end up lugging around aluminum imacs and fax machine guts back and forth.</p>

    	</div>

    	<div id="decided">
    		<p>inspired by the workshop <a href="http://www.aaronparsekian.com/">Aaron Parsekian</a> gave about the basics of taking apart electronics, i decided to start simple by trying to get rid of the plastic casing around the blender </p>
    	</div>

    	<div id="scrape">
    		<p>i used the plastic scrap-y thing Aaron distribued during the workshop to peel open the bottom part of the casing</p>

				<p>the giant capacitors scared me so i checked them out with a multimeter.</p>

				<p>in retrospect, i don't know how productive this was, but it was very satisfying to free this control board and see that, like Aaron said, the components were huge and labeled and generally approachable to follow. my greed told me to take the relays for myself (which would have been useful/fun for my current project with <a href="https://aileenstanziola.com/">Aileen Stanziola</a> making a 1-bit solar adder where we are making the logic gates ourselves. <a href="https://hackaday.com/2010/11/18/electromechanical-computer-built-from-relays/">look at this computer.</a> </p>

				<p>i used a drill inappropiately to basically destroy as much as i could to break the shell</p>

				<p>the axis remained safe and sound despite all of my efforts.</p>

			<div id="rubber">
				<p>eventually i got to a hard rubber core protecting the axis. i didn't know how to cut it so i gave up. a couple of days later, i spend about 40 minutes futilely running a utility knife over the same groove trying to make some sort of destructive progress, but nothing happened.</p>

    	<div id="hardware">
    		<p>i also took apart this wood and delrin structure thinking the metal hardware would be useful to others. it was also being used to combine smaller pieces of wood into a larger surface, which i found interesting because i have been thinking a lot about possible processes to combine scraps of itp-y materials (cardboard, acrylic, plywood) into composite surfaces for reuse. </p>

    		<p>unfortunately, i have yet to see anyone use the metal hardware for anything since i've seen this. using metal hardware to make structures isn't really in the itp vernacular currently. i think usually things are designed to machined to a point where screws and glue will be used as fasteners. i'm not really sure what the advantage is of using metal hardware, other than i guess i've been seeing a lot of metal hardware and i myself dont' really know what to do with it at this point. more research is needed.</p>

    		<p>in retrospect, i am not sure if my deconstructive efforts helped the community much. one possible improvement would maybe to have desolder some of the ocmponents, as i have see the "free store finds" bin (info in a following post) of the shop being depleted lately. </p>
