        <p id="intro">another ridiculously late post. this is documentation of my freestore session that occured on 2019-03-03. this session, i continued my focus on the "bottom shelf".</p>

        <p id="carted">i carted as much as i could into a classroom so i could sort into piles, such as: </p>
        <ul id="catlist">
        	<li>metal hardware (later collected into the makita bag)</li>
        	<li>rubber pieces (later put into the center "raw material" drawer)</li>
        	<li>cables and jacks (put into the crates of discarded cable by the wood shop)</li>
        	<li>actuators (put into the electronic components left drawer)</li>
        	<li>visual objects (things like a distinctly recognizaable apple keyboard, a clock, fish bowl, computer mouse, etc)</li>
        	<li>enclosures for metal (i could not see these as likely to be used, so i unfortunately put these metal scraps into technoscrap with the hope that they will be recycled. )</li>
        	<li>electronic boards (put into the right drawer, as a drawer of things that could be desoldered)</li>
        	<li>intact electronic products (put into the top right drawer, as sort of a gadget box)</li>
        	<li>screws went to the shops tray i refer to as the screw graveyard, as well as the nuts/bolts/rods into other similar bins.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>i also attempted to sort through all of the tiny objects that fell through the bottom shelf's wire construction, but much of it was a mysterious silvery dust. i should i have taken a picture of it in aggregate but sadly only have this one of some in a corner of my carting-box.</p>

        <div id="trash">
        <p>i then did a sweep of the things under the bottom shelf. i saved some extremely old electronics, but most were small things covered in a threateningly shiny dust.</p>
