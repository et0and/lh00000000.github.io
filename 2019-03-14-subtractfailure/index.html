        <p>unanswered question, why did it cut all the way through if i put a quarter inch for depth</p>

        <p class="long">theory: because my shapes were 0.26 thin and the cnc was using settings recommended for material hitting the end mill on the 12'oclock and 3'oclock side, some material was hitting the 9'oclock side which broke my end mill</p>
        <p class="long">other theory: spindle let go of the bit midway, then broke from having pressure focused on a very small portion of the end mill. this is although i was repeatedly tightening the spindle based on Emily Lin's experience that it was spindle was constantly getting loose. maybe i tightened too much which was unnecessary force on the the end mill?</p>
        <p class="long">i went back and increased the width of my pockets to 0.3inch but at this point, the cnc signup schedule was already many people behind. </p>

        <p class="long">i had signed up for another hour slot, but the same 3-person bunching effect occurred the following day and i was not able to use the cnc before the shop closed. </p>
