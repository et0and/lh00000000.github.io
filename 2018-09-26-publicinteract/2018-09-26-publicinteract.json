    "Pick a piece of interactive technology in public, used by multiple people. Write down your assumptions as to how it’s used, and describe the context in which it’s being used. Watch people use it, preferably without them knowing they’re being observed. Take notes on how they use it, what they do differently, what appear to be the difficulties, what appear to be the easiest parts. Record what takes the longest, what takes the least amount of time, and how long the whole transaction takes. Consider how the readings from Norman and Crawford reflect on what you see.",

    "- linknyc representatives insist that the kiosks cannot be hacked ^4",
    "although ive heard anecdotal evidence of usage of the other \"features\" of the kiosks, from the tablet computers, charging ports, or \"informational\" displays of some of their brand/data partnerships, i have not been able to witness any of these interactions. despite this, i believe the public usage of the linknyc is an archtypical example of a class of interaction that is only growing more important to study every day. that of ",
