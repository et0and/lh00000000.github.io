this is a blog post for itp 2018 physical computing - post class 02 + pre class 03

### READING 01 : NORMAN, DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS, CH. 1
- i think interface unfriendliness = mismatch between interface designer's imagined audience (expertise / common practices) and reality
- many software services present menus in the form of series of animated minimalist illustrations, controlled by interfaces with only or two buttons, with copy written in a leisurely informal tone. for someone that would prefer a leisurely paced introduction to the available settings of a piece of software, this might be welcomed. for the casual user coming to the menu after recently reading an article that disturbed them about facebook's default privacy settings, this might seem evil. i've recently been very excited to adopt command line applications like todo.txt and ti for everyday computing things, like tracking time and todo lists. i find it reassuring to be able to use text-editor find-and-replace functionality to re-organize my data when i suffer from another episode of internal ontological epistemology crisis-and-rebirth. to recommend the same applications to someone unfamiliar with the terminal (i.e. people who haven't spent the time setting up the [barrage of autocomplete](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) functionality and [colorful modifications](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) necessary to make their terminal use "fun" because they had something actually fun or societally useful to do) would be an embarrassing thing to do.
- there is designing for saving time teaching someone about something
  - faster = guide through the practical aspects of the most common feature as soon as possible
  - slower = present projections of the core mental model via collection of functionality
  - what is the middle way?
- there are also the obvious but exciting examples of deliberately challenging design too that i am currently too sleepy to comprehensively sample from right now, so i will just list these extremely commercial ones:
  - bring back [this bloomberg design](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/haters-side-bloombergs-loud-redesign-touts-future-web-news/)
  - does anyone else remember that time when the gap [rebranded as proto-everlane then chickened out and undid it all](http://kevenelliff.com/what-we-can-learn-from-gaps-failed-rebranding/)
- although i would personally like to avoid making things hard for other people for no reason, there's something about the language of "user-friendliness" that has also struck me as smug and self-aggrandizing
  - "He was on the second floor and we were looking out the window, and he said, "What about the man on the street?" At that moment . . . Jackson Pollock was crossing the street. " - morton feldman
  - "Terms like "simplicity,"usability," "user experience," or "emotional design" describe an implementation of this ideology, glossing over increasingly restrictive, belittling, and exploit-native systems with elements of entertainment or simulation of meaning... In other words: the Invisible User is more of an issue than an Invisible Computer. This Invisible User, without a name, a role, or any interest, who is assumed to always have something better to do, is not the center of digital culture. She is not even considered part of it." - Do You Believe In Users? - Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied
- this is not to say i disagree with the utopian view that knobs that say "FREEZER" adjust something about a freezer, and not some flap inside of a pipe that goes more places than just a freezer

### READING 02: EMOTION & DESIGN: ATTRACTIVE THINGS WORK BETTER - JND.ORG
https://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/emotion_design_at.html
- the neurological model that Norman basis his argument on is not one i'm familiar with but if i read correctly, his thesis seems to be "one feature of a design is the attempt to placate the user with attractiveness" which i can't say i disagree with.
- the phrase Norman uses, "modifications to the normal state of cognitive processing" is interesting to me because it presented a more contextual/temporal approach to design that i don't feel i hear about as often as i do the typical race towards static, unchanging "Best Designs".


### READING 03: PHYSICAL COMPUTINGâ€™S GREATEST HITS (AND MISSES
https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/
- the mechanical pixels entry reminded me of [(the teeming void): After the Screen: Array Aesthetics and Transmateriality](https://teemingvoid.blogspot.com/2011/04/after-screen-array-aesthetics-and.html), but that might be because i only found that around because Igoe in another publishing (that i could not find tonight)
- the mechanical pixels entry resonated the most with me because i think it is the category (of this particular taxonomy) that focuses most (although they all have their strengths) on depicting more direct responses to the societal effects of computation.
- this made me realize i have been carrying around another new-media taxonomy, that i will now share under the condition that you don't laugh at me for how underdeveloped it is
	- nongui to nongui
		- contains Igoe categories
			- theremin-like instructions
			- gloves
			- body/hand as cursor
		- aim (again, just my sleep deprived opinion)
			- the dominant computational media exchange has been
				- input: text or specifying points on a visual image
				- output: visual images of aggregates of that (originally at least)  text data
				- so the interesting thing about these projects (to me) is that they present alternate inputs and outputs (sounds, expression, movement) that highlight how narrow the focus of the computational world has been so far, and hints at the possibility of completely unpredictable alternate futures
	- realtime-post-prod
		- contains Igoe categories
			- video mirror
			- scooby doo painting
			- dolls and pets
		- aim
			- with a visually dominant human history, visual art, photography,  video, television, and cinema are the lingua franca of modern society
			- in most of the known examples of the above, the the post-production aspects are almost as conceptually responsible for the essence of images as the subjects and contexts of the actual images
			- realtime-post-production presents a last-mile focus to these processes by creating custom but analogous systems of image manipulation for realtime experimentation
	- augmented space
		- contains Igoe categories
			- floor pads (or wall pads?)
			- things you yell at
			- fields of grass
		- aim
			- use the interactivity of new media to emphasize and amplify the various social and conceptual dynamics  and possibilities inheritent when occupying any space
		- also place-in-room focused "immersive" installations
	- lifestyle at scale
		- contains Igoe categories
			- mediation helper
			- multitouch surface / multi player
			- remote hugs / data transfer of emotions
			- tilty stands and tables
		- aim
			- i see these as near-future musings on speculative lifestyle trends
			- and anything speculative = modern commentary
	- homage to the database
		- contains Igoe categories
			- mechanical pixels
			- LED Fetishism
		- aims
			- themes of multiplicity and repetition that hint at subjects of supply, production, and global economic systems
			- grids and modularity as expressions of "scalability" and encapsulation/abstraction
			- reversal of the Data Imitates Life pipeline
