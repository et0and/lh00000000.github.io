        <p>for the second othermill assignment for subtraction (itp 2019 w Ben Light) i wanted to create a better version of the stave card i attempted the previous week. better as in with smaller troughs so my music staves didn't have to be 3 inches wide.</p>
        <p>i thought i could get around the problem of not having a smaller bit (than 1/8th of an inch) but finagling some kind of sandwich structure, where there would be areas on the outside of the sandwich that would be engraved so that small lines could build the stencil, and small pieces from the top-layer could hold the lines in place. it is hard to explain. this is basically what i was thinking:</p>

        <p>the more i thought about it, the more excited i got. i wanted to </p>
        <ul>
            <li>practice aluminium</li>
            <li>practice making parts in th eothermill that are meant to be put together </li>
            <li>learn how to make due with bigger bits</li>
            <li>finaly stop the experience of having to re-write music ideas when trying to harvest them from my physical notebooks</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>failure #1</h1>
        <p>i planned to do this the night before, hoping to temporarily catch up on sleep by going to bed at 9pm and getting up at 3am to get to itp at 4am. i have no idea why i thought this was a good idea at the time. </p>

        <p>after spending a lot of time in vectorworks to basically just copy and paste squares, i realized that using the top piece that have little raised islands of the top piece would require a small bits basically as small as as the 1/32nd bit i was trying to fake in the first place</p>
        <i>below: i was hoping to have extrusions from the top layer fit in the bottom. i somehow didn't realize until 7am that my extrusions would be a 1/16in apart. </i><br />

        <p>i suppose that if one were to stagger the extrusions diagonally, it could work, but i thought the final size of the stencil cutaways would make the whole thing useless. so i decided to just cut my losses and mill something to test my sandwich idea (3 layers, bottom has engraved edge to half thickness, holding 2nd layer engraved to half thickness, top layer is engraved to half thickness except plug extrusions to fit into pockets of 1st layer)</p>

        <p>new design ! but now it's an hour before class and i spend forty minutes not knowing that when you are you export dwgs from vectorworks with the intent of importing into illustrator, you must change the version of dwg to 2002. this info was went over in class + it's probably somewhere on the itp.nyu.edu/fab but sadly i was too stupid and panicked to remember it find it in time. </p>

        <h1>failure #4</h1>
        <p>i go to class with nothing accomplished and spend the whole day reflecting on my stupidity. after all of my other classes/commitments, i finally get in front of the othermill at 10pm, more than 13 hours late.</p>

        <p>i take out the sheet metal that <a href="https://rashidakamal.com/">rashida kamal</a> under the incorrect assumption that i would do something worthwhile with it and lay out some tape. </p>

        <p>dumped some svgs for bantam. mostly to get separate the different pieces (to switch out material) and divide between inside-outside milling and cutting-vs-engraving.</p>
        <i>now that i'm looking at this screenshot, i don't know why i thought it was better to engrave away the center hole instead of just cutting an inside-cut square like the rest of the stuff...</i>
        <img src="https://lh00000000-public.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/siteimg/2019-02-23-otherfailure/mysvgs.png" />
        <p>i decided to start with the piece that would be sandwiched, which i took to calling <i>the coin</i></p>
        <img src="https://lh00000000-public.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/siteimg/2019-02-23-otherfailure/engravednice.jpg" />
        <p>time to pop it out ! ...except its not a material for cutting in the othermill so i pretty much just wasted my time having an othermill smudge around a soft metal...</p>

        <i>a flexible and easily avoidable waste of time...</i>
        <h1>failure #5</h1>
        <p>it is almost 2am at this point and i just want to mill <i>something</i> (red alert). i open up illustrator and fire up the comic sans.</p>
        <img src="https://lh00000000-public.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/siteimg/2019-02-23-otherfailure/bantamgiveup.png" />
        <p>...then i run into my original problem again. apparently i can't conceive of milling anything that doesn't require a bit smaller than an 1/8 inch. after a lot of bolding and scaling, i just hit start on a piece of scrap FR1.</p>

        <p>i learned a lot during this assignment</p>
        <ol>
            <li>i lack three-dimensional intelligence</li>
            <li>i thought i was doing badly at school but apparently i could somehow do worse</li>
            <li>i should always just buy the tool you're "supposed to" use because i don't have the competency to "finagle it"</li>
            <li>apparently whatever the itp recommendation is, i am going to get obsessed with doing something that is trivial to do with the two-sizes-down equipment</li>
            <li>i need to quit some things so i can avoid having the accumulated effects of 3hour sleeps</li>
