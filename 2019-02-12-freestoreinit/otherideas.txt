cardboard instead of drawers to change size / improvise containers more often
testing of component to shop drawers faster to gain momenteum
james also suggested an instagram to showcase mechanisms (lots of students are using instagram for 100days, so many otheres are using the instagram platform often)
guestbook for informal (date - what you used and how - did you put back? (phrased in a why that doesn't imply expectation of putting stuff back)


observations
trash was small but annoying
as i was trying to sort a sixth, the sixth immediately filled up again
people put extremely new things there (new shoes, adafruit boxes with new components). i assume that this is because of high expectation for usage
material areas around the free store were confusing to everyone (including me) i.e. didn't know we had pvc bin, is the wall of sorted acryllic up for grabs? what to do with stuff that's expiredd? if there's tracking on all the wood and stuff, why does it feel unofficial to respect the expiration dates? are the cables being used by someone?
the three  people i talked to suggested things like throwing out a lot of the wood and sorting out small materials, which i think is already implemented. these are people i consider to use the free store much more than average so i was surprised they were not aware of the current processes of the shop. maybe a wiki or email (packaged with stuff like announcements of the workshops / process on the cross-school/shop collabs) would be helpful
interviewees talked a lot about tragedy of commons, and people not doing thier individual part. i personally think that a everyone-gives-100% policy ignores contextual error rate (i personally believe there should somehow be a community understanding that a 80%-125% effort is needed from everyone which is a mouthful), and claimed that the free store would always be a disaster unless there were a dedicated party to it. they were surprised when i told them there now was.
